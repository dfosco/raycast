# Raycast Goodies

Raycast snippets + goodies by @dfosco

For a basic overview, check [this discussion](https://github.com/github/growth-life-cycle/discussions/209) with a basic guide for Raycast (GH-staff only)

## Initial Setup

Clone this repository locally and add its folder as your Script Directory on Raycast settings:

The scripts in this folder should appear in the list:

## Simple Commands

### Random Usernames

Add a random username to your clipboard from a list of 100 names. 

> [!TIP]  
> This list was created randomly with an LLM to be a somewhat accurate representation of GitHub usernames — might accidentally contain real people names, **don't use for designs that show up in production**!

### Count Characters

For when you need to know if a text fits in your design... if you know you know.

## Advanced Commands

> [!WARNING]  
> Before you can use these two commands, replace the contents of `_repositories-folder.txt` with the path of the folder where you keep repositories in your Mac

The output copied to your clipboard will not include the actual folder name, so make sure to add it. 

In this case, the output was `/Users/dfosco` and I added `/Workspace` so the file contains a single line with:

```
/Users/dfosco/Workspace
```

### Open Repo in VS Code

Quickly open any local repository in VS Code, just type its folder name.

> 1. Open VS Code
> 2. Press `cmd + shift + p`
> 3. Search for “code command” and choose the option below:
