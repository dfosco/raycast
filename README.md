### Simple Commands

#### Random Usernames

Add a random username to your clipboard from a list of 100 names. 

> [!TIP]  
> This list was created randomly with an LLM to be a somewhat accurate representation of GitHub usernames — might accidentally contain real people names, **don't use for designs that show up in production**!

#### Count Characters

For when you need to know if a text fits in your design... if you know you know.

The output copied to your clipboard will not include the actual folder name, so make sure to add it. 

In this case, the output was `/Users/dfosco` and I added `/Workspace` so the file contains a single line with:

```
/Users/dfosco/Workspace
```
